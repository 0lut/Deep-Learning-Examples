LIPO is algortihm for finding global maximas of special functions called Lipschitz functions. You can find the paper here (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02628)
.
In this example we will use MaxLIPO (a modified version of LIPO). We will use it for training a small neural network for MNIST data set. The algorithm will pick dropout and learning rates for us.!!

Note: You need tensorflow and dlib library to use the sample code.
